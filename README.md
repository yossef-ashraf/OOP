# Java OOP Examples Repository

## Overview
This repository contains examples and demonstrations of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts implemented in Java. It serves as a comprehensive reference for understanding and applying OOP principles in Java applications.

## Features
- Comprehensive demonstration of Java syntax and OOP concepts
- Examples of classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism
- Practical implementations of various Java programming techniques
- Docker support for easy execution in containerized environments

## OOP Concepts Demonstrated
- **Classes and Objects**: Creating and using Java classes and objects
- **Encapsulation**: Using access modifiers (public, private, protected)
- **Inheritance**: Extending classes and reusing code
- **Polymorphism**: Method overloading and overriding
- **Abstraction**: Abstract classes and interfaces
- **Inner Classes**: Regular inner classes and static nested classes

## Code Examples Include
- Variable declarations and types
- Constructors and method implementations
- Control structures (if-else, switch, loops)
- Exception handling with try-catch-finally
- Arrays and collections
- Static and instance methods
- Wrapper classes and autoboxing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher
- Docker (optional, for containerized execution)

### Running the Examples
Clone the repository and compile the Java files:
```bash
javac App.java
java App
```

### Using Docker
The repository includes a Dockerfile for containerized execution:
```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t java-oop-examples .

# Run the container
docker run -it java-oop-examples
```
